## Description
Hi! My name is Illia, here I practice my skills at writing markdown texts, LaTeX formulas and other related fun stuff.

## My favourite university subjects
Currently my favourite subjects are: 
 1. Mathematical analysis
 2. Analitical geometry and linear algebra
 3. Algorithmithation and programming
 4. AI and IDA basics

 ## Online VS Offline studying
 Here is what I think about each of the studying options:

|     Online    |    Offline    |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| More sleeping hours | Additional walk in the fresh air  |
| More time for your own business  | Live communication  |

## My favourite mathematical formulas
Here are some of my favourite mathematical formulas:

$$

y = \alpha x^2 + \beta x + \gamma

$$

, - this is the parabolic function formula;

$$

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

$$

, - this is the Pythagorean theorem;

$$

D = b^2  - 4ac, x_1 = \frac {-b + \sqrt{D}}{2a}, x_2 = \frac {-b - \sqrt{D}}{2a}

$$

, - these are formulas for caclulating discriminant and roots of the quadratic equation;

$$

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, (a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)

$$

, - these are some of abbreviated multiplication formulas.

## My coding skills
I'm skilled enough to do some coding - here is one of the examples:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    cout << "Hello, GitHub!" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
In this example the `main()` function is the key to print the "Hello, GitHub!" message in the console and then end the program successfully. 

Use [C++ Schell](https://cpp.sh/) to check the code out.

## The image I like

Here is the image I like: it represents the power and beauty of nature illustrating the spectacular view of mountain range
